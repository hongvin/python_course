    "'\n",
    "This tool is essentially your data's home. Through `pandas`, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. `pandas` will extract the data from that CSV into a `DataFrame` — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "    - What's the average, median, max, or min of each column?\n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",
    "- Visualize the data with help from Matplotlib. Plot bars, lines, histograms, bubbles, and more.\n",
    "- Store the cleaned, transformed data back into a CSV, other file or database\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you jump into the modeling or the complex visualizations you need to have a good understanding of the nature of your dataset and pandas is the best avenue through which to do that."
